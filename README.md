# exploratory-data-analysis-of-indian-companies
In this analysis we will use the dataset "Indian Companies Registration Data [1857 - 2020]" found on [Kaggle]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rowhitswami/all-indian-companies-registration-data-1900-2019)).

The registered_companies.csv file contains the details of all Indian companies ever registered in India from 1857 to 2020.

Number of Rows= 1992170
Number of Columns= 17

During this project, I created visualizations (bar, pie & boxplots, sunburst & heat maps etc.) using libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium, etc.
After analyzing the data and making clear visualizations, it came to conclusion that **Reliance Jio** is tha largest company in the country in terms of capital.
